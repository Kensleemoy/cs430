## Overview
WHAT IS MANDELBROT?
```````````````````
Fractal patterns are common in nature. They are obtained by repeating a simple process again and again in a loop.
Abstract Fractals, for example Mandelbrot Set is generated by a computing a simple equation in a loop.

MANDELBROT SET is the set of complex numbers "c" for which the function 
     f(z) = z^2 + c
does not diverge when iterated from "z=0" i.e the sequence f(0),f(f(0)) etc remains bounded in absolute value.

PA4 IMPLEMENTATION FOR MANDELBROT
`````````````````````````````````
This code was adapted from [Mandelbrot Code Serial](https://gist.github.com/andrejbauer/7919569),
however the OpenMP and CUDA adaptations are our own contributions to the base Mandelbrot algorithm.

## Compiling

To compile, run from root directory:
````````````````````````````````````
**For Serial**
make mandelbrot

**For OpenMP**
make mandelbrot-omp

**For CUDA**
make mandelbrot-cuda

## Running & Converting

To run, run from root directory:
````````````````````````````````
**For Serial**
./bin/mandelbrot <out.ppm>

**For OpenMP**
sbatch slurm_openmp.bash

**For CUDA**
sbatch slurm_cuda.bash

This will create a .ppm file at the location of your choosing or will
default to the root directory.

If you want to convert this to a .png file, you can run
the command:
```
convert -normalize <your .ppm file name> <desired .png file name>
```

OR, if you want to change the color:
```
convert -negate -normalize -fill blue -tint 100 <your .ppm file name> <desired .png file name>
```
** NOTE: We have found that convert works best on onyx.


Example of running and converting (from root directory):
```
./bin/mandelbrot pic.ppm
convert -normalize ./pic.ppm ./converted.png
```
