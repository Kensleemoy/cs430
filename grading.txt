README.md

The README is very thorough. I like that you have a target to make each
toy separately. 
I had a hard time finding the command to run the automated tests.

Score 20/20

BUILD SYSTEM

In order to have Make create a bin/ and obj/ directory only when needed,
you can add the "mkdir -p <dir>" to your makefile so that you don't have to
worry about creating the executable and object files directories every time. 
I struggled with the same issue as you: Github was not pushing any empty directories
and I found the command above to fix that issue. 

Score 20/20

TESTING FRAMEWORK

Your testing script is impressive. However, I think you can make the running of that 
script a little bit more intuitive. I would add it to the Makefile so that you can just
run "make test" and get the results.
