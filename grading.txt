Kenslee Moy - Grading Ravi's PA1

README.md - 18/20
Clear and easy to understand README, it just
is missed some descriptions of the programs so
that the reader can get a brief overview of how
your programs function and the usage for each.

Build System - 9/10
It works without any errors, but there are
warning errors that would be nice to remove.

Testing Framework - 28/30
Testing framework is easy to use and makes without
any errors. I just took off some points as it 
doesnt test all 5 programs, but it is really nice
to use and it looks great visually.

Code Functions - 4/10
Fibonacci and Monte Carlo work as intended, but
those are the only 2 programs in the project.

Directory Structure - 10/10
It's organized in a logical manner

Code Review - 4/10
The code for the working programs look good and
are fairly simple.
